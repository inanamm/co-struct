# WHAT TO DO

## When booting up to work
1. (in Terminal) composer install –> installs the php packages defined in composer.json
2. composer start –> to start the local server (localhost:8000)
3. (separate Terminal) npm install –> installs the node packages defined in package.json
4. npm run watch –> to listen to tailwind changes and save them as css in style.css

## When creating a new project
1. git init –> creates a .git folder (where this project lives locally)
2. gh repo create –> github client to create a remote repository on github
